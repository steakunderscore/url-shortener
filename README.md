# URL Shortener

My very own URL shortener!

## What

A URL shortener to practice some thing I just learnt. A lot of this will be overkill, but it's for learning.

## Tech to use

Things I want to use for practice:

- Go
- gRPC
- Microservices
- Docker
  - Scratch image[1][2]
- Kubernetes

Things that will get used along the way:

- Vim
